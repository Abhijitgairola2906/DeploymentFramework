{"name":"Deployment Framework for BizTalk (BTDF)","tagline":"Professional and powerful deployment automation for your BizTalk applications","body":"# Overview\r\nThe Deployment Framework for BizTalk (BTDF) eliminates the pain associated with BizTalk application deployments, and goes far beyond BizTalk’s out-of-the-box deployment functionality. It also includes additional tools to enhance developer productivity, such as binding file management.\r\n\r\n**The Deployment Framework for BizTalk is the single most powerful and customizable, yet _easy-to-use_ toolkit for deploying and configuring your BizTalk solutions.**\r\n\r\n### Top Five Reasons to Use the Deployment Framework for BizTalk\r\n1. Deploy a complex solution containing orchestrations, schemas, maps, rules, custom components, pipeline components, pipelines -- even ESB itineraries -- in *minutes*, with no human intervention\r\n2. Eliminate ALL manual steps in your BizTalk deployments \r\n3. Consolidate all of your environment-specific configuration and runtime settings into one, easy-to-use Excel spreadsheet\r\n4. Maintain a SINGLE binding file that works for all deployment environments\r\n5. Make automated deployment a native part of the BizTalk development cycle, then use the same script to deploy to your servers\r\n6. Bonus Reason: It's free!\r\n\r\n**This project exists due to countless hours of volunteer effort by ONE developer at a time!
