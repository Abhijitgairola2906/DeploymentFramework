<p>The Deployment Framework for BizTalk eliminates the pain associated with BizTalk application deployments, and goes far beyond BizTalk’s out-of-the-box deployment functionality. It also includes additional tools to enhance developer productivity, such as binding file management.</p>

<p><strong>The Deployment Framework for BizTalk is the single most powerful and customizable, yet <em>easy-to-use</em> toolkit for deploying and configuring your BizTalk solutions.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Deploy a complex solution containing orchestrations, schemas, maps, rules, custom components, pipeline components, pipelines -- even ESB itineraries -- in <em>minutes</em>, with no human intervention</li>
<li>Eliminate ALL manual steps in your BizTalk deployments </li>
<li>Consolidate all of your environment-specific configuration and runtime settings into one, easy-to-use Excel spreadsheet</li>
<li>Maintain a SINGLE binding file that works for all deployment environments</li>
<li>Make automated deployment a native part of the BizTalk development cycle, then use the same script to deploy to your servers</li>
<li>Bonus Reason: It's free!</li>
</ol>
